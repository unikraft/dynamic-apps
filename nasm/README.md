# Netwide Assembler

This is the netwide assembler and it is meant to be used in the binary compatibility mode of unikraft.

## Content
- sample_code.s: a sample assembly code file that can be assembled using nasm.
- usr/bin/nasm: the nasm binary
- lib/ & lib64/: the required libraries for nasm

## Extract dynamic libraries
```../extract.sh usr/bin/nasm```

output:
```
Copying /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 ...
Copying /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ...
```

## Run on linux
```nasm sample_code.s```

## Run on unikraft
```./run.sh -r ../dynamic-apps/nasm/ usr/bin/nasm sample_code.s```

This should generate the output file ```sample_code``` which is the assembled machine code generated by nasm.
