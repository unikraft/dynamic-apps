# Netwide Assembler

This is the (Nasm) Netwide assembler and it is meant to be used in the binary compatibility mode of Unikraft.

## Content

- `sample_code.s`: a sample assembly code file that can be assembled using Nasm
- `usr/bin/nasm`: the Nasm binary
- `lib/` & `lib64/`: the required libraries for Nasm

## Extract Dynamic Libraries

```console
../extract.sh usr/bin/nasm
```

output:

```
Copying /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 ...
Copying /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ...
```

## Run on Linux

```console
nasm sample_code.s
```

## Run on Unikraft

```console
./run.sh -r ../dynamic-apps/nasm/ usr/bin/nasm sample_code.s
```

This should generate the output file `sample_code` which is the assembled machine code generated by Nasm.

We can use this command to check that everything worked properly:

```console
objdump -D -b binary -m i386 -M intel,x86-64 sample_code
```
